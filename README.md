## Testimony Portal - A Basic Website for Sharing Stories

This project provides the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a basic testimony portal website. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

**Structure:**

- **Navigation Bar:** Includes a logo, navigation links (Activities, Testimony Categories, Contact, Login), and an "Upload Testimony" button. A hamburger menu is displayed for smaller screens.
- **Hero Section:** Features a background image (optional), a heading ("Welcome to the Testimony Portal"), and a brief description about sharing experiences.
- **Testimony Categories:** Displays a grid of categories (e.g., All Testimonies, Childbirth, Finance) for filtering testimonials. Each category uses an icon and a descriptive text.
- **Footer:** Contains copyright information.

**Features:**

- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts its layout for optimal viewing on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Animations:** Subtle animations are applied to the hero section's heading and paragraph on page load.
- **Hover Effects:** Hover effects are implemented on buttons, navigation links, and category cards for visual feedback.
- **Mobile Navigation:** A hamburger menu is used on smaller screens to access navigation links.
- **Upload Testimony Button:** While not functional in this basic version, the button's presence suggests a future implementation for submitting testimonies.

**Customization:**

- You can replace the placeholder logo, banner image, and content with your own branding and information.
- The category icons and text can be modified to suit your specific testimonial areas.
- Consider adding functionalities like searching, filtering, and displaying testimonials based on chosen categories.
